            Depending on how you obtained the Windows
            software, this is a license agreement between (i) you
            and the device manufacturer or software installer that
            distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you
            and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you
            live or, if a business, where your principal place of
            business is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired
            the software from a retailer. Microsoft is the device
            manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or
            one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the retailer if you
            acquired the software directly from Microsoft. Note
            that if you are a volume license customer, use of this
            software is subject to your volume license agreement
            rather than this agreement.
            This agreement describes your rights and the
            conditions upon which you may use the Windows
            software. You should review the entire agreement,
            including any supplemental license terms that
            accompany the software and any linked terms,
            because all of the terms are important and together
            create this agreement that applies to you. You can
            review linked terms by pasting the (aka.ms/) link into a
            browser window.
